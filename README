This Google Chrome extension will help you close voting questions on Stack Overflow.

You can define a (regex) filter and tags and this extension will mark the close vote suspects for you in the questions overview.

This is only the experimental version 0.1.0, more functionality will be implemented in the future (like connection with chat and automatic detection of duplicates).
