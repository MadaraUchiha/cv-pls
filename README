Just playing with creating Chrome extensions.

This extension will [cv-pls] questions on Stack Overflow.

Currently it replaces ALL PHP question with [cv-pls] http://stackoverflow.com/question/id/title. Useful isn't it :-)

This is only version 0.0.1, more functionality will be implemented in the future (like connection with chat).
